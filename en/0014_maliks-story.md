# Malik's story

##
My name is Malik and I am 39 years old. I was born in Afghanistan. My religion is different from the main religion in Afghanistan.

##
For many years, people who belong to my religion have been persecuted. This has been very difficult for my family.

##
A few years ago there was a war. I was afraid someone would kill me. I left my family and tried to go to Europe to start a new life.

##
I walked for many kilometres, and sometimes I had neither food nor a place to stay. Some of the people I travelled with died.

##
Finally I arrived. I met some people from my own country who helped me. I do not know what I would have done without them.

##
I started to learn the language, but it was hard. I knew that speaking the language is important to get a job.

##
I studied for several years, at first to learn the language. It was demanding, but I enjoy learning new things.

##
After studying I started working. First I worked in a restaurant, then I became a teacher because I want to help others.

##
I hope to go back to Afghanistan one day. Many people there need help, and I want to help them.
