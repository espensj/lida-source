# The sound of birds in the morning

##
Yulia, her husband, and their little daughter lived in a small, quiet village in Ukraine. Yulia enjoyed waking up every morning to the sound of birds. She never thought she would live far away from home, or not be woken up by the sound of birds in the morning.

##
However, her husband was always complaining about the lack of money and began drinking a lot. They decided to try their luck in Portugal to earn some money to build a house and a better future for their family.

##
Yulia adapted well in her new home, and she started working as a domestic helper. People really appreciated her work and her polite attitude. Her husband, on the other hand, felt more and more left out. Because of his drinking problem, employers did not trust him enough to give him work.

##
One day he started yelling at Yulia. Later he started pushing her. The violence increased with shouting and beatings, especially when he was drunk. Yulia was afraid for herself and her daughter, but did not know what to do.

##
When Yulia had to go to the emergency room in the hospital with a broken arm, she was informed that domestic violence was a huge problem in Portugal. They also said it was a crime and should be reported to the police.

##
Yulia was tired and did not want her little daughter to grow up in a home where she witnessed violence on a daily basis. Yulia realised that the signs of violence had been there all along, even if they took different forms.

##
Yulia went to a women's shelter, where she felt safer than she had in a long time. She had not felt like that since when she was woken up by the sound of birds in the morning.
