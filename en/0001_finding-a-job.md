# Finding a job

##
Alisha needs a job because her family needs money for food and clothes.

##
Alisha did not work in her home country, but she is good at cooking and likes talking to people.

##
Maybe she can work in a restaurant? Alisha searches on the Internet for job postings.

##
She finds a job posting as a chef. That is someone who cooks in a restaurant.

##
She goes for the job interview. The restaurant manager tells her they need someone with education as a chef.

##
Alisha is disappointed, but she takes a course called "Food and hospitality". That will help her get a job in a restaurant.

##
Alisha has to work in a restaurant as part of her education. She does not get a salary, but she gets work experience.

##
She writes the name of the course on her CV. That is a description of all the work she has done and all the courses she has taken.

##
Next time Alisha goes for a job interview, she is offered the job. It is hard work. She often has to work in the evening, when her children are home from school.

##
She is proud that she can buy food and clothes for her family with her own money.
