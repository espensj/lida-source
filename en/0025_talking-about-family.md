# Talking about family

##
"Do you have any family?"

##
"Yes, my husband and I have two daughters and a son."

##
"I have two daughters too. But I'm divorced."

##
"How old are your daughters?"

##
"Mina is four years old. She goes to preschool. Miriam is ten, so she goes to school."

##
"All of my children go to school. My son will graduate next year."

##
"That is great! They grow so fast. What will he do then?"

##
"He wants to work, but I tell him he should go to university."

##
"That's a good idea. I also hope my children will do that."
