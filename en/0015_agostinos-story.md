# Agostino's story

##
My name is Agostino and I am 51 years old. My job is to deliver food by bicycle. I have two daughters, but we hardly ever speak. Their mother and I no longer live together since we are divorced.

##
I live with my mother since I could not pay rent after the divorce. Rent is very expensive in this city.

##
A few months ago I worked as a janitor for a company. I repaired things that were broken, carried boxes and helped out when anyone needed it. One day the company fired me. I did not understand why.

##
I saw many people delivering food by bicycle. I can also ride a bicycle, so I knocked on the door of a big delivery company. They offered me 3€ for each delivery. I make 40€ per day, 60€ if I am very lucky and the customers tip me.

##
I get no paid vacation, no sick leave, hardly any rights at all. I do not think that is right, but I need a job. Most of the other employees are immigrants who come from all over the world.

##
Many of us delivery people get injured in small and big accidents on a daily basis. When a 25-year-old delivery man got hit by a car and died, the authorities started noticing us. It is a shame someone had to die for that to happen.

##
Together with the delivery people from other companies, I took a course in workers' rights with a local union. They offered us legal advice free of charge. We struggled to get ever more recognition and rights.

##
After a long time our hard work paid off. A big delivery company was told by the court to pay a huge fine and to hire workers in permanent positions. It was the first time that happened anywhere in the whole world. It looks like things are starting to improve.
