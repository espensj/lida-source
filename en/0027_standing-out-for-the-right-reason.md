# Standing out for the right reason

##
Edson was born in Angola, just after the country became independent. He was a very tall boy. Because of his height he stood out. The people who were giving weapons to children to fight as soldiers in the civil war wanted boys like him.

##
His mother was afraid they would take him, so she decided to send him to live in Portugal with an aunt. She thought he would be safe there.

##
It was very difficult to begin with, as Edson missed the warm weather, the traditional food and, most of all, his mother's hugs and kisses.

##
He did not speak Portuguese well and found it very hard to follow his classes and the conversations of his classmates. He wondered if it was a good idea to come to Portugal after all.

##
One day a teacher noticed how good he was at basketball. He joined a basketball team and was very successful. He became popular at school and made friends. He also became more confident.

##
Now that he is an adult, Edson trains refugee children and others at risk of being excluded from society. Once, his height put him in danger of becoming a child soldier. Now, his height gives him strength to help others feel safe.
