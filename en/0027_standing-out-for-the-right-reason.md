# Standing out for the right reason

##
Edson was born in Angola, right after the country became independent. He was a very tall boy. Because of his height he stood out. The people who were giving weapons to children to fight as soldiers in the civil war, wanted boys like him.

##
His mother was afraid of losing him, so she decided to send him to live in Portugal with an aunt. There he would be safe, she thought.

##
The early days were very difficult because Edson missed the warm weather, the traditional food, and most of all his mother's hugs and kisses.

##
He did not speak Portuguese well, and it was very hard to follow the classes and the conversations of his classmates. He wondered if it was a good idea to come to Portugal after all.

##
One day a teacher noticed how good he was at playing basketball. He joined a basketball team and was very successful. He became popular at school and made friends. He was also more confident.

##
Now, as an adult, Edson trains refugee children and others at risk of social exclusion. His height, which in the past put him in danger of becoming a child soldier, has become his strength for helping others feeling included and safe.
