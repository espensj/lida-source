# An old man as a husband

##
I thought Norwegian men were the best men in the world, but that's not the case! Before I met the man who would become my husband, I worked in a factory in Bangkok, whereas he lived in Pattaya. We got to know each other through the Internet and eventually became a couple.

##
After a while we decided to get married. I came from a poor family, so having a foreign husband who could take care of my family was part of my reason for marrying him.

##
We moved to Norway, and I started going to school to learn Norwegian. It was a difficult time. I didn't have a driver's licence and my husband had to drive me to school, wait for me, and drive back, one hour each way. After a while we moved closer, yet he insisted on driving me. He didn't want me to walk alone.

##
I have hardly had any money since I came to Norway. Once he gave me money for lunch, but since I had so little money, I kept it. My friends at school want to help me to get a job, but my husband says I can't. He doesn't think working as a cleaning lady is appropriate for me.

##
Instead he had another job for me â€“ to build a garage. He was the boss and I did everything. He can't do much because he is ill. He didn't give me any of the money he made for building the garage.

##
One day he told me he is bored when he is home alone, so he decided to get a dog. I didn't want a dog since I'm tired after school and I have homework. He said he would walk the dog every day, but in the end, I had to take care of both the dog and my old husband.

##
I don't know what the future will bring. My plan is to go to another school, but my husband doesn't want me to do that, so he is planning to move far away to make it difficult for me. I want to resist, but I don't know how. It was certainly not as easy to live abroad with an old man as I once imagined.
