# Buying medicines

##
Tom has a toothache. His tooth hurts very much.

##
He needs to see his dentist. But first he needs medicines for the pain.

##
He drives to the nearest pharmacy.

##
"I have a toothache," he says. "Do you have any medicine for that?"

##
"Yes, here are some painkillers. You don't need a prescription for those."

##
"Thank you. How much do they cost?"

##
"They cost nine Euros. But you should see a dentist."

##
"Yes, I will call my dentist tomorrow morning."

##
"If you need stronger medicine, your doctor or dentist must give you a prescription."

##
"Thank you! Goodbye."
