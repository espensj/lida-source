# Getting medicine

##
Tom has a toothache. His tooth hurts very much.

##
He needs to see his dentist, but first he needs something for the pain.

##
He drives to the nearest pharmacy.

##
"I have a toothache," he says. "Do you have anything for that?"

##
"Yes, here are some painkillers. You don't need a prescription for these."

##
"Thank you. How much do they cost?"

##
"They cost nine euros. But you should see a dentist."

##
"Okay, I will call my dentist tomorrow morning."

##
"If you need stronger medicine, you will need to get a prescription from your dentist or doctor."

##
"Thank you! Goodbye."
