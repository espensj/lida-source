# Coming to Norway

##
My two brothers and I came to Norway in December 2016. We wore summer clothes because we thought it would be as warm in Norway as it was in Somalia. However, when we arrived at the airport, it was snowing. We were cold and the weather was chilly. Although we had brought a few suitcases, they only had summer clothes in them.

##
Even though it was cold, I was very happy when we came to Norway. I would finally meet my mum again, whom I had not seen for six years. My mum and two of her friends met us. When we saw her, we wept with joy. We drove to the small town where Mum lives.

##
The first days in Mum's town were very strange. It was cold and snowy and there was not much to see. The streets were completely empty. The few people I met seemed cold and unfriendly. In Somalia there were people everywhere, so everything felt unfamiliar here. My mum and her friends gave us some presents, and then she took us to buy winter clothes.

##
After the Christmas holidays I joined a Norwegian course at the adult education centre. I studied there for two years before starting in an ordinary school. Now I am in my final year, and I have made many new friends. I am very sociable and enjoy meeting other people.

##
After school I go to a centre run by volunteers where I get help with my homework. I have also joined a sewing course at the centre.

##
In Somalia I never went to school or did any courses except Quran school. I did not know how to read or write. Now I have learned how to write in both Somali and Norwegian, and many other subjects. Without education I felt I was nobody. Now I feel knowledgeable and happy.

##
Next year I will start secondary school in the health and youth development section. In the future I want to become a youth worker. When I have finished my education, my dream is to get a permanent job. I also want to learn how to drive and get my driver's licence.

##
If I had stayed in Somalia, I think I would have been a mother by now. Perhaps I would already have many children. If I had been in Somalia, I would not have had the same opportunities as I have had now. I feel lucky to live in Norway.
