# Coming to Norway

##
My two brothers and I came to Norway in December 2016. When we came to the airport, it was snowing. We only wore summer clothes because we thought it was as warm in Norway as in Somalia. We were cold and the weather was chilly. We brought a few suitcases with clothes, but only summer clothes.

##
Even though it was cold, I was very happy we came to Norway. Here I could finally meet my mom, whom I hadn't seen in six years. My mom and two of her friends met us. When we met our mom once again, we wept with joy. Mom lives in a small town, so we drove there.

##
The first days in town were very strange. It was cold and snowy and there was little to see. The streets were completely empty. The few people I met seemed cold. In Somalia there were people everywhere, so everything felt unfamiliar here. My mom and her friends gave us gifts, and she took us to buy winter clothes.

##
After the Christmas holidays I joined a Norwegian course in the adult education centre. I studied there for two years before starting in an ordinary school. Now I'm finally in my last year, and I've gotten new friends. I'm very sociable and enjoy meeting other people.

##
After school I go to a volunteer centre to get help with my homework. At the centre I've also joined a sewing course.

##
In Somalia I never got to go to school or join a course, except Quran school. I didn't know how to read or write. Now I've learned how to write in both Somali and Norwegian. I've also learned many subjects. Without education I felt like I was nobody. Now I feel knowledgeable and I'm happy.

##
Next year I will start secondary school in the health and youth development section. In the future I want to become a youth worker. When I'm done with my education, I dream about getting a permanent job. I also want to learn how to drive and get a driver's licence.

##
If I had stayed in Somalia, I think I would have been a mom now. Perhaps I would have had many children already. If I had been in Somalia, I would not have had the same opportunities as I've had now. I feel lucky to live in Norway.
