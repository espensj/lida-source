# Talking about the weather

##
"It is getting cold these days. What is the temperature now?"

##
"It is nine degrees. It is still autumn, but soon it will be winter."

##
"I look forward to spring. I prefer the summer, when it is nice and warm."

##
"I do not mind the cold. It is the rain and wind I do not like."

##
"Look at those dark clouds. Tomorrow it will rain. It will be very windy too. Perhaps there will be a storm."

##
"I hope not. I really do not like bad weather, especially thunder and lightning. I am afraid the lightning will hit me."
