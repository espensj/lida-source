# Talking about the weather

##
"It's getting cold these days. What's the temperature now?"

##
"It's nine degrees. It's still autumn, but soon it will be winter."

##
"I look forward to spring. I prefer the summer, when it's nice and warm."

##
"I don't mind the cold. It's the rain and wind I don't like."

##
"Look at those dark clouds. Tomorrow it will rain. It will be very windy too. Perhaps there will be a storm."

##
"I hope not. I really don't like bad weather, especially thunder and lightning. I'm afraid the lightning will hit me."
