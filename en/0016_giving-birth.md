# Giving birth

##
Selamawit is 29 years old. She gave birth to her first child in Eritrea. She and her family had a hard time there, so they decided to go to Italy.

##
Inga left home just before she turned 19. She moved to Norway and had her first child there.

##
When Selamawit became pregnant with her second child, she wondered what it would be like to have a child in a different country.

##
Selamawit and Inga come from different backgrounds. Selamawit felt safe because she had experience with giving birth. Inga talked to her mother about giving birth.

##
Both women had heard that, in most European countries, pregnant women have the right to antenatal care. This means that they will get help during their pregnancies. Selamawit made an appointment with her doctor as soon as she realised she was pregnant. Selamawit's husband drove her to the doctor.

##
The doctor did some tests and found out that Selamawit had a kind of diabetes that some pregnant women get. She had to eat healthy food and exercise. Selamawit was glad she went to the doctor early, before she and her baby became ill.

##
When Inga's neighbour heard that she was trying to have a baby, the neighbour told her to see a doctor as soon as she was pregnant. That way she could make sure that she and her baby were healthy. The doctor told her to take folic acid, a vitamin that is important for pregnant women.

##
Inga and her doctor agreed that she would meet a midwife for regular check-ups during her pregnancy. The midwife gave her advice on food and rest, and information on how to keep herself and her baby safe and well.

##
Both women gave birth to healthy babies. Selamawit had another son, while Inga had a daughter. Their husbands were very proud, and they told everyone they knew about their strong wives and healthy children.
