# Buying clothes

##
Ali's shirt is old. He needs a new one.

##
He goes to the shopping mall to look for new clothes.

##
In the shopping mall he cannot find the clothing store.

##
He goes into a shop to ask for directions. "Where can I buy clothes?" he asks.

##
The shopkeeper points to the other side of the mall. The clothing store is on the opposite side!

##
Ali goes in and looks for a shirt. The shirts are too big for him, and quite expensive.

##
He buys a new pair of trousers instead because they are on sale. He decides he will buy a shirt next month when he gets his salary.
