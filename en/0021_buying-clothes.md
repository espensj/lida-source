# Buying clothes

##
Ali's shirt is old. He needs a new one.

##
He goes to the shopping mall to look for new clothes.

##
In the shopping mall he can't find the clothes store.

##
He goes to another shop to ask for directions. "Where can I buy clothes?" he asks.

##
The shopkeeper points to the other side. The clothes store is on the opposite side!

##
Ali enters and looks for a shirt. The shirts are too big, and quite expensive.

##
He buys a new pair of pants instead. They are sold at a discount. He decides to buy a shirt next month.
